# Synchronous Programming
In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another, in a sequential order. The code waits for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. This can lead to blocking, where the program cannot continue until the current task finishes.

- Example:

  Here’s a simple synchronous example using fs.readFileSync to read a file in Node.js:
  
  ```ruby 
  const fs = require('fs'); 
  console.log('fs');

  const readeData = fs.readFileSync("./data.txt");
  console.log(readeData);
  ```

# Asynchronous Programming
In asynchronous programming, tasks are executed independently of the main program flow. The program can continue executing other code while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This approach helps avoid blocking and can lead to more responsive and efficient applications.

- Example:

   Here’s an example using fs.readFile for asynchronous file reading:

```ruby
  const fs = require('fs'); 
  console.log('fs'); 
  
fs.readFile("data.txt", "utf8", (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
  } else {
    console.log("Files data:", data);
  }
});
```
